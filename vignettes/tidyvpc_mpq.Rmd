## Introduction

A Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is typically assessed visually by checking:

- calibration (are observations inside simulated prediction intervals?)
- bias and trend (does the model systematically miss in certain x regions?)
- sharpness (are prediction intervals unnecessarily wide?)

The **Model Predictive Quality (MPQ)** score in `tidyvpc` is a *numeric* summary of these features, computed from an existing `tidyvpcobj` after `vpcstats()`.

MPQ produces a table `mpq.stats` and a composite scalar **`qc_score`** (**lower is better**) that can be used for automated model comparison and optimization.

## What MPQ measures (methodology overview)

MPQ is computed from `o$stats` (the `data.table` produced by `vpcstats()`), which contains (for continuous VPCs) curve points across quantiles:

- `qname`: quantile curve (e.g. `q0.05`, `q0.5`, `q0.95`)
- `y`: observed curve value at x
- `md`: simulated median curve at x
- `lo`, `hi`: simulated confidence interval bounds at x for that quantile curve

At each curve point, MPQ derives:

- **Coverage**: whether \(y \in [lo, hi]\)
- **Deviation**: \(|y - md|\) relative to PI half-width
- **Drift**: Spearman correlation of residuals \((y-md)\) versus x (monotonic bias)
- **Sharpness**: interval width (penalizes “variance inflation”)
- **Proper interval score (Winkler)**: rewards narrow intervals but penalizes misses

These are aggregated across curves and combined into `qc_score` with user-controlled weights.

### Penalties (what is printed)

`mpqstats()` prints a scalar `qc_score` plus a component breakdown. Each component is designed to be **0 = best** and larger values = worse.

At a high level:

- **Coverage penalties** measure calibration (are observed curves inside simulated uncertainty bands?).
- **MAE and drift penalties** measure agreement and bias structure (how far and whether the residuals trend with x).
- **Sharpness and interval penalties** discourage “variance inflation” (overly wide bands that can artificially increase coverage).

More concretely (continuous VPC):

- **Median coverage penalty** (`coverage_penalty_med`): computed from the median quantile curve (the curve closest to \(q=0.5\)):
  \[
  1 - \text{mean}(\mathbf{1}[y \in [lo,hi]])
  \]
  Lower is better; 0 means the observed median curve is always inside the simulated band.

- **Tail coverage penalty** (`coverage_penalty_tails`): computed from the lowest and highest quantile curves available (typically \(q=0.05\) and \(q=0.95\)), averaged:
  \[
  \frac{(1-\text{coverage}_{low}) + (1-\text{coverage}_{high})}{2}
  \]

- **MAE penalty** (`mae_penalty_all`): based on deviation scaled by PI half-width:
  \[
  dev\_mid = \frac{|y-md|}{(hi-lo)/2}
  \]
  then bounded to \([0,1]\) and averaged across curves. This highlights “large misses relative to the model’s own uncertainty”.

- **Drift penalty** (`rho_penalty_all`): absolute Spearman correlation of residuals \((y-md)\) vs x (averaged across curves), bounded to \([0,1]\).
  Values near 0 indicate no monotonic bias trend across x; larger values indicate systematic drift.

- **Sharpness penalty** (`sharpness_penalty`): penalizes wide bands using relative width:
  \[
  width\_{rel} = \frac{(hi-lo)}{|md|}
  \]
  By default (single-VPC scoring), this is mapped to \([0,1)\) with a bounded transform:
  \[
  1 - e^{-\max(width\_{rel}, 0)}
  \]
  Optionally, you can anchor this with `sharp_ref` for cross-model comparability.

- **Interval penalty** (`interval_penalty`): based on the Winkler interval score for nominal PI level \((1-\alpha)\):
  \[
  IS = (hi-lo) + \\frac{2}{\\alpha}(lo-y)\\mathbf{1}[y<lo] + \\frac{2}{\\alpha}(y-hi)\\mathbf{1}[y>hi]
  \]
  This rewards narrow intervals but strongly penalizes misses. By default we apply a bounded transform to a normalized score; optionally you can anchor with `interval_ref`.

Finally:

\[
qc\_score = \sum_i w_i \cdot penalty_i
\]

where `w` is the named weight vector (`med_cov`, `tail_cov`, `mae`, `drift`, `sharp`, `interval`).

## Data

We’ll use the built-in `tidyvpc::obs_data` and `tidyvpc::sim_data` and follow the standard preprocessing used throughout our vignettes.

```{r}
obs_data <- as.data.table(tidyvpc::obs_data)
sim_data <- as.data.table(tidyvpc::sim_data)

obs_data <- obs_data[MDV == 0]
sim_data <- sim_data[MDV == 0]
```

Add the population prediction `PRED` (from replicate 1) into the observed data for pcVPC examples:

```{r}
obs_data$PRED <- sim_data[REP == 1, PRED]
```

## Example 1: Basic MPQ scoring

Below is a standard continuous VPC using binless VPC stats. The MPQ computation is a post-processing step after `vpcstats()`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
vpc <- observed(obs_data, x = TIME, y = DV) %>%
  simulated(sim_data, y = DV) %>%
  binless() %>%
  vpcstats()

vpc <- mpqstats(vpc)

print(vpc)
```

The composite score is available in `mpq.stats$qc_score` (for stratified VPCs you will also see an `mpq_scope == "overall"` row).

Plot the VPC:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, out.width=640}
plot(vpc)
```

## Example 2: MPQ with prediction correction and stratification

MPQ relies on `vpc$stats`, so it naturally works with prediction correction and stratification (for continuous VPCs).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
vpc_pc_strat <- observed(obs_data, x = TIME, y = DV) %>%
  simulated(sim_data, y = DV) %>%
  stratify(STUDY ~ GENDER) %>%
  predcorrect(pred = PRED) %>%
  binless() %>%
  vpcstats()

vpc_pc_strat <- mpqstats(vpc_pc_strat)
print(vpc_pc_strat)
```

Plot the stratified pcVPC:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, out.width=640}
plot(vpc_pc_strat)
```


### Interpreting differences between `vpc` and `vpc_pc_strat`

In the vignette examples you printed:

- The **prediction-corrected + stratified** VPC (`vpc_pc_strat`) shows a **lower drift penalty** (residuals trend less with x), because prediction correction and stratification often remove structured bias that would otherwise appear as monotonic drift.
- At the same time, `vpc_pc_strat` can show **higher sharpness/interval penalties** if the simulated uncertainty bands are wider within strata (or if prediction correction changes the scale/structure of residuals), because MPQ explicitly penalizes overly wide intervals even when they improve coverage.
- The **per-stratum qc_score table** helps localize which subpopulations drive the overall score: strata with worse calibration (coverage penalties) or wider uncertainty (sharpness/interval penalties) will typically have higher `qc_score`.

## Example 3: MPQ scoring with traditional binning()

MPQ works with traditional binned VPCs as well (it scores directly from `vpc$stats`). The only difference is that `vpcstats()` will compute summaries at `xbin` instead of `x`.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, out.width=640}
vpc_binned <- observed(obs_data, x = TIME, y = DV) %>%
  simulated(sim_data, y = DV) %>%
  binning(bin = NTIME) %>%
  vpcstats()

vpc_binned <- mpqstats(vpc_binned)

print(vpc_binned)
```

## Example 4: Noisy simulations → wider confidence intervals → worse MPQ

One failure mode of purely visual scoring is that *very wide* simulated confidence intervals can appear to “cover everything”.
MPQ penalizes this via **sharpness** and **interval score** components.

Here we artificially add noise to the simulated DV values to create wider confidence intervals, then compare `mpq.stats`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
sim_data_noisy <- copy(sim_data)

# Increase variability of simulated DV values; this should widen lo/hi bands.
sim_data_noisy[, DV := DV + rnorm(.N, mean = 0, sd = 25)]

vpc_base <- observed(obs_data, x = TIME, y = DV) %>%
  simulated(sim_data, y = DV) %>%
  binless() %>%
  vpcstats() %>%
  mpqstats()

vpc_noisy <- observed(obs_data, x = TIME, y = DV) %>%
  simulated(sim_data_noisy, y = DV) %>%
  binless() %>%
  vpcstats() %>%
  mpqstats()

base_overall <- vpc_base$mpq.stats[mpq_scope == "overall"]
noisy_overall <- vpc_noisy$mpq.stats[mpq_scope == "overall"]

cmp <- rbindlist(list(
  cbind(data.table(case = "base"), base_overall),
  cbind(data.table(case = "noisy_sim"), noisy_overall)
), fill = TRUE)

cmp[, .(
  case,
  qc_score,
  coverage_penalty_med,
  coverage_penalty_tails,
  sharpness_penalty,
  interval_penalty
)]
```

In this comparison you will typically see:

- **sharpness_penalty** increases with wider prediction intervals
- **interval_penalty** increases because the Winkler score increases with width (even if coverage improves)
- therefore **qc_score** tends to increase (worse)

Compare the two plots:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6, out.width=640}
    qc_base <- vpc_base$mpq.stats[mpq_scope == "overall", qc_score][1]
qc_noisy <- vpc_noisy$mpq.stats[mpq_scope == "overall", qc_score][1]

p_base <- plot(vpc_base) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle(sprintf("Base (qc_score = %.3f)", qc_base))

p_noisy <- plot(vpc_noisy) +
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle(sprintf("Noisy sim (qc_score = %.3f)", qc_noisy))

egg::ggarrange(p_base,
               p_noisy,
               nrow = 2, ncol = 1,
               top = "VPC CI Comparison"
)

```


## Tips for using `sharp_ref` and `interval_ref`

By default (`sharp_ref = NULL`, `interval_ref = NULL`), MPQ uses **self-normalizing bounded transforms** so you can score a single VPC without external calibration.

If you are comparing *many* models (e.g. search/optimization) and need more stable cross-run comparability, set:

- `sharp_ref`: a reference sharpness level (e.g. median across a model population)
- `interval_ref`: a reference interval-score level (e.g. median/75th percentile across models)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vpc <- mpqstats(vpc, sharp_ref = 0.15, interval_ref = 2.5)
```
